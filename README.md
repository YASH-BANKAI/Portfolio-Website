## About 

This is my portfolio website created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Following is the description of areas where these technologies are used :

## HTML 

HTML is used for defining basic structure of the website by using tags such as `<div>`, `<span>`, `<form>` and `<p>`.

## CSS 

CSS is used for designing the web page and add hover effects. 
With the help of CSS, I had gave background colour to the web page and navbar, created hover effects, changed font and colour of texts and used opacity for further changes.

JavaScript is used as a main logic to enhance user interactivity. With the help of Js, scrolling effect of navbar, changing of background color in navbar and changing image effect has been created.
